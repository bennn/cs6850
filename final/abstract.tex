\label{abstract}

Herd behavior in stock markets is a fairly well-studied subject.
The earliest relevant literature dates back to the late 1980's \cite{bikhchandani}, and since then a number of experiments and theoretical models have observed and characterized the behavior.
These results established that herding exists and offer reasonable suggestions for modeling the phenomena.
However, high-frequency trading has overhauled our conception of a securities market, and little to no published literature explores this phenomena.

We introduce a new model for evaluating herd behavior, specifically tailored to high-frequency markets.
Through simulations we determine expected patterns of interactions and then evaluate their accuracy against real exchange data.
